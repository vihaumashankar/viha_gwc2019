     <h3>Creating New Turbines</h3>
     <p>There are four designs to be created during this experiment. Three vertical axis turbines and one horizontal axis turbine. The first turbine will mimic what commonly used vertical axis turbines look like: it will have four blades with a long axis and two motors. It will be referred to as the Layered Vertical Axis Wind Turbine, or the Layered VAWT. The reason that this turbine is different from common vertical axis turbines is that of the number of blades and the blade	design: typically vertical axis turbines only have three blades, and those blades are curved and curled around the post. Whereas here there will be four blades and each blade will be flat against the axis. For the second design, it will simply be one layer of the Layered VAWT and will be referred to as the Flat Vertical Axis Wind Turbine, or Flat VAWT. This turbine will have long blades that stretch horizontally in line with the vertical axis. A design like this has not been made, and despite its overall unsafe structure, it will be tested to see if it is efficient. The third design will be another vertical axis design, but this time the blades will be downwards rather than to the side. To be referred to as the Tree Vertical Axis Wind Turbine, or Tree VAWT, no design like this exists to this day, therefore like the Flat VAWT, it will be tested to see if it is in	fact efficient. Its blades will be at a 45-degree angle to the motor, spinning downwards and around the post. The final design will be a horizontal axis turbine, referred to as the Angled Horizontal Axis Wind Turbine, or Angled HAWT. It looks like a traditional horizontal axis	turbine, but the blades will be flat and at a 45-degree angle to the motor. Rather than having blades that turn themselves, everything will be stable and flat against the motor. As for materials and procedure, each turbine and its exact materials will be designed and	decided at a later date. The blades and base will be made and shaped out of balsa wood. The posts and axis will be made of skinny wooden dowels, and the motors made out of wooden washers. Because the entire turbine will be made out of wood, it is important to discuss the friction that will be created [3]. To reduce the amount of friction, one must add a lubricant. In	this case, the axis and the inside of the motor where the axis sits will be coated with rubber cement. Applied in a thin layer, the rubber cement will not only smoothen the wood to allow it to	turn better, but also provide a layer in between the wood and the wood, reducing the friction tremendously.</p>
