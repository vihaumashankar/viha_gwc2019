    <h3>How Turbines Work</h3>
		<p>According to the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, wind energy is the
		process where the wind is used by a machine to generate mechanical power or energy. The use of
		wind energy is a reliable, renewable, and clean energy source [14]. The office says, “wind is a
		form of solar energy and is a result of the uneven heating of the atmosphere by the sun, the
		irregularities of the earths surface and rotation of the earth” (US Department of Energy, 2014).
		The blowing air passes on both sides of the blade, like an airplane wing. The uneven air pressure
		of the blades allows the head to spin. In a standard design, the shaft only rotations at 18 RPM,
		but when it is connected to the motor, that rate jumps up to 1800 RPM [15].
		The design of the turbine is quite simple: wind rotations the blades of the turbine around
		a rotor which is connected to the main shaft, which in turn spins a generator to create electricity
		[15]. It is essentially the opposite of a fan, fans using electricity to produce wind where wind
		turbines use wind to produce energy. GE explains each part of the turbine well: the blades “lift
		and rotate when hit by wind, causing the rotor to spin”, the rotor being a “combination of the
		blades and hub”, the pitch system “rotations blades out of the wind to control rotor speed. Also,
		stops the rotor from spinning in conditions where the wind is blowing too slow or too fast”, the
		generator “produces 60-cycle AC electricity within the turbine”, the controller “starts and stops
		the turbine from working depending on conditions”, the yaw drive “controls upwind turbines to
		orient them should wind direction change”, and finally the tower which they describe as “the
		base of the turbine, build to support the rest of the structure” [8]. They stretch tall because the
		higher in the atmosphere they go, the stronger the winds they pick up. The turbine blades are
		long (typically around 150 feet) so they have a greater swing area and more momentum [15].</p>
