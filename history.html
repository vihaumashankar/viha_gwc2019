			    <h2>How Turbines Work</h2>
			    <p>Wind turbines are based on the design and function of windmills. Windmills during ancient civilizations had a vertical axis and consisted of “sails connected to 	a vertical shaft
					connected to a grinding stone for milling” (Kalmikov, Dykes, Araujo, 2010). As the Middle Ages arrived, the horizontal axis mill is introduced where “sails connected to a horizontal shaft
					on a tower encasing gears and axles for translating horizontal into rotational motion for
					translating horizontal into rotational motion” (Kalmikov, Dykes, Araujo, 2010). Finally, in the
					US during the 19 th century, water pumping windmills with a horizontal axis became more
					popular. As for turbines themselves, Charles Brush built the first wind turbine that generated
					electricity in 1888. It was quite large, with a 17m diameter and a 12 kW generator. In the 1890s,
					the Lewis Electric Company of New York began selling generators to attach to existing
					windmills. Later, in the 1920s-1950s, the horizontal axis wind turbine became much more
					popular, and into the 1960s, wind farms began being built [9].</p>
