		<h3>Types of Wind Turbines</h3>
		<p>Large wind turbines are more cost effective and overall most popular. They can be found
		in large wind farms and are used industrially to create more energy overall. They are connected
		to each other using a utility grid to collect and distribute the power. The amount of energy that
		these turbines produce powers cities. On the other hand, small turbines are used for homes to
		power smaller appliances and other devices around the house. They are less expensive in
		comparison to the cost of large wind turbines, but they do not produce nearly as much energy.
		These turbines are connected directly to the house, eliminating the need for a utility grid. Finally,
		there has been a recent rise in wind farms over water. These are known as offshore wind farms.
		Offshore turbines generate much more power but are very hard to install. The winds over bodies
		of water are generally much stronger than winds over land, therefore being much more efficient.
		But due to their size and location, it is hard to get the parts to the location of the farm [7].</p>
